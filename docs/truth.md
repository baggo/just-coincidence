# Truth

To know how true coincidences are, we have a process below (which can be automated)/ It produces a float that is `0` through `1`.  Where:

 - `0` means the coincidence is false or has no evidence
 - `1` means the coincidence is true

The process can never produce `1` because you cannot guarantee a contribution and events in the past to be true
